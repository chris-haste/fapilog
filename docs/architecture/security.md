# Security

Security implementation focused on **core library safety**, **plugin ecosystem security**, and **enterprise compliance** while maintaining developer simplicity.

## Input Validation

- **Validation Library:** Pydantic v2 for all configuration and event validation
- **Validation Location:** At API boundaries before any processing begins
- **Required Rules:**
  - All external inputs MUST be validated before entering the async pipeline
  - Validation at configuration loading and event creation points
  - Whitelist approach for allowed values and patterns
  - Async validation patterns for performance-critical paths
