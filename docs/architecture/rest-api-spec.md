# REST API Spec

## Core Library: No REST API

The core fapilog library is a **Python library only** - no web server, no REST API, no complexity.

## Optional Plugin Marketplace API

If the community grows large enough, a **simple GitHub Pages site** could provide:

- Plugin discovery and search
- Installation instructions
- Plugin ratings and reviews
- **No database required** - all data sourced from GitHub API and PyPI API
