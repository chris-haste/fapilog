# Infrastructure and Deployment

Since Fapilog v3 is a **Python library** (not a service), the infrastructure and deployment approach is fundamentally different from traditional applications:

## Infrastructure as Code

- **Tool:** GitHub Actions (workflow automation)
- **Location:** `.github/workflows/`
- **Approach:** Library-focused CI/CD with plugin ecosystem validation

## Deployment Strategy

- **Strategy:** Package Distribution via PyPI
- **CI/CD Platform:** GitHub Actions
- **Pipeline Configuration:** `.github/workflows/ci.yml`, `.github/workflows/release.yml`

## Environments

- **Development:** Local development with `pip install -e .`
- **Testing:** GitHub Actions runners with matrix testing (Python 3.8-3.12)
- **Staging:** TestPyPI for release candidates
- **Production:** PyPI for stable releases

## Environment Promotion Flow

TestPyPI (Release Candidates)
       ↓
PyPI (Stable Releases)

User Environments (pip install fapilog)
```

## Rollback Strategy

- **Primary Method:** PyPI version pinning and yanking
- **Trigger Conditions:** Critical bugs, security vulnerabilities, performance regressions
- **Recovery Time Objective:** < 1 hour (immediate PyPI package yank)

## Framework Lifecycle Integration
