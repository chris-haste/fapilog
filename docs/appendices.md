## Glossary

### A

**Async-First Design**
A design approach where all operations are asynchronous by default, ensuring non-blocking behavior and high performance.

**Audit Logging**
Comprehensive logging for compliance and security purposes, including immutable records and integrity verification.

### B

**Backpressure**
A mechanism to handle situations where the system receives more messages than it can process, preventing resource exhaustion.

**Batching**
Grouping multiple log messages together for efficient processing and transmission.

### C

**Context Binding**
The process of attaching request-scoped information to log messages for correlation and debugging.

**Circuit Breaker**
A pattern that prevents cascading failures by temporarily stopping operations when error thresholds are exceeded.

### D

**Deduplication**
Removing duplicate log messages within a configurable time window to reduce noise and storage.

**Dedup Window**
The time period during which duplicate messages are identified and removed.

### E

**Envelope**
The standardized structure that contains all log message data, including metadata, context, and the actual log content.

**Enrichers**
Components that add additional metadata to log messages, such as runtime information or business context.

### F

**Facade**
The main logging interface that developers interact with, hiding the complexity of the underlying pipeline.

**Fallback**
A mechanism that provides alternative behavior when primary operations fail.

### G

**Guarantees**
Promises about system behavior, such as async operations, bounded memory usage, and graceful degradation.

### H

**Hot Reload**
The ability to update configuration and plugins without restarting the application.

### I

**Intersphinx**
A Sphinx extension that enables cross-references between different documentation projects.

### J

**JSON Lines**
A format where each line is a valid JSON object, commonly used for log aggregation and processing.

### L

**Lock-Free Design**
A concurrent programming approach that avoids locks and blocking, improving performance and scalability.

### M

**Metrics**
Quantitative measurements of system behavior, such as throughput, latency, and error rates.

**Middleware**
Software that runs between the application and the logging system, providing additional functionality.

### N

**Non-Blocking**
Operations that don't prevent other operations from proceeding, essential for high-performance systems.

### O

**Observability**
The ability to understand system behavior through logs, metrics, and traces.

**Overflow**
A condition where the message queue reaches its capacity limit, requiring backpressure handling.

### P

**Pipeline**
The sequence of processing stages that log messages go through, from creation to output.

**Plugin**
Extensible components that add custom functionality to fapilog, such as custom sinks or processors.

**Processor**
Components that transform and optimize log messages, such as batching or compression.

### Q

**Queue**
A buffer that stores messages between processing stages, handling backpressure and ensuring smooth operation.

### R

**Redactor**
Components that remove or mask sensitive information from log messages for security and compliance.

**Ring Buffer**
A circular data structure used for efficient message queuing with bounded memory usage.

**Runtime**
The execution environment where fapilog operates, including lifecycle management and resource allocation.

### S

**Sink**
The final destination for log messages, such as files, HTTP endpoints, or stdout.

**Structured Logging**
Logging that uses structured data formats (like JSON) instead of plain text, enabling better analysis and processing.

**Serialization**
The process of converting log messages to a format suitable for transmission or storage.

### T

**Throughput**
The rate at which the system can process log messages, typically measured in messages per second.

**Trace ID**
A unique identifier that links related log messages across different parts of a distributed system.

### U

**Use Case**
A specific scenario or requirement that demonstrates how fapilog can be used to solve real problems.

### V

**Validation**
The process of ensuring that log messages conform to expected formats and constraints.

**Versioning**
A system for managing compatibility between different versions of fapilog and its plugins.

### W

**Worker**
Background processes that handle log message processing, ensuring non-blocking operation.

**Work Stealing**
A load balancing technique where idle workers can take work from busy workers.

### Z

**Zero-Copy**
A technique that minimizes memory allocation by reusing existing data structures.
