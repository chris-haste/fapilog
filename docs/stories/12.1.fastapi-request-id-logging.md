# Story 12.1: FastAPI request_id Logging (Correlation ID Middleware, Concurrency-Safe)

**Status:** Ready
**Priority:** P0 (High)
**Depends on:** None
**Epic:** 12.0 Cookbook (SEO-Driven Documentation)

---

## Context / Background

"FastAPI request id logging" and "FastAPI correlation id middleware" are among the most searched logging queries. Developers hit concurrency issues where request IDs "overlap" or appear in wrong requests when they don't use async context correctly.

fapilog solves this with built-in context propagation that is concurrency-safe by design.

**Target search queries:**

- "FastAPI request id logging"
- "FastAPI correlation id middleware"
- "request ids overlapped fastapi"
- "python async context logging"

**Why fapilog is the answer:** Built-in context variables that propagate correctly across async boundaries without manual threading.local() hacks.

---

## Scope (In / Out)

### In Scope

- Cookbook page explaining the concurrency problem
- Minimal middleware setup snippet
- How to access request_id in deeper application layers
- Explanation of why IDs overlap and how fapilog avoids it

### Out of Scope

- Full middleware implementation (link to existing docs)
- Distributed tracing integration (separate cookbook page)
- Custom ID generation strategies

---

## Acceptance Criteria

### AC1: Page Exists with Correct Title

**Description:** Cookbook page created with SEO-optimized title.

**Validation:**
```
docs/cookbook/fastapi-request-id-logging.md exists
H1: "FastAPI request_id logging (correlation ID middleware, concurrency-safe)"
```

### AC2: Problem Section Explains Concurrency Issue

**Description:** Clear explanation of why naive approaches fail.

**Validation:**
- Describes the "overlapping IDs" problem
- Shows why threading.local() doesn't work with async
- References real pain points from Stack Overflow

### AC3: Solution Shows Minimal Working Code

**Description:** Copy-pasteable example that works.

**Validation:**
```python
from fastapi import FastAPI, Depends
from fapilog.fastapi import setup_logging, get_request_logger

lifespan = setup_logging()
app = FastAPI(lifespan=lifespan)

@app.get("/")
async def root(logger=Depends(get_request_logger)):
    logger.info("request_id is automatically included")
```

### AC4: Deep Access Pattern Documented

**Description:** Shows how to access request_id in service/repository layers.

**Validation:**
- Example of getting request_id outside of route handlers
- Pattern for passing context to sync code if needed

### AC5: Why It Works Section

**Description:** Brief technical explanation of fapilog's approach.

**Validation:**
- Mentions contextvars (not threading.local)
- Explains automatic propagation across await boundaries
