# Story 10.0: Epic 10 Overview - Developer Experience and Ergonomics

## Context / Background

fapilog is async-first and production-ready, but its developer experience is behind loguru and structlog. This epic focuses on reducing boilerplate and enabling progressive disclosure: simple defaults for new users, with advanced controls still available.

## Scope (In / Out)

### In Scope

- Add ergonomics improvements that reduce setup to 1-3 lines for common use cases.
- Keep all changes additive and backwards compatible.
- Deliver a cohesive story set (10.1 to 10.9) aligned to the epic goals.

### Out of Scope

- Breaking changes to the existing Settings API or plugin system.
- Removal of advanced configuration options.
- New external services or cloud dependencies.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. Stories 10.1 through 10.9 are created with clear scope, AC, tasks, and tests.
2. Each story is independently shippable or has explicit dependencies.
3. Success metrics are documented for validation after delivery.
4. No story proposes a breaking change.

## Implementation Notes

- This story maps Epic 10 content into the 10.x story series.
- Assumption: new APIs are optional and do not change default behavior unless explicitly enabled.
- Dependencies: 10.1 presets should land before 10.6 defaults and 10.8 auto-detection.

## Tasks

- [ ] Confirm scope and ordering for stories 10.1 to 10.9.
- [ ] Validate dependency assumptions with maintainers.
- [ ] Add the 10.x stories to any roadmap tracking (if used).

## Tests

- N/A (planning and documentation only).

## Risks / Rollback / Monitoring

- Risk: scope creep due to multiple overlapping APIs.
- Rollback: remove story docs or reprioritize without code impact.
- Monitoring: track adoption metrics (time to first log, setup lines, README conversions).
