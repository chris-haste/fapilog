# Story 10.9: DX Documentation and Migration Guide

## Status: Planned

## Priority: High

## Estimated Effort: Medium (2-3 days)

## Dependencies

- **Depends on:** Stories 10.1-10.8 (All DX features) - Documents all new features

## Epic / Series

Part of Epic 10: Developer Experience and Ergonomics / Series 10.x

---

## Context / Background

DX improvements need clear documentation, examples, and migration paths for users coming from stdlib logging, loguru, and structlog.

## Scope (In / Out)

### In Scope

- New DX comparison page and quick start guide.
- Migration guides for stdlib logging, loguru, structlog, and older fapilog.
- Examples repository updates aligned to new APIs.

### Out of Scope

- Video tutorials or marketing content beyond documentation.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. Side-by-side comparison page for fapilog vs loguru vs structlog.
2. Quick start guide showing presets and one-liner FastAPI setup.
3. Migration guides with code translation examples.
4. API reference updated for new methods (presets, builder, add_file).
5. Examples under `examples/` updated and tested in CI.
6. FAQ updated with common questions about presets and migration.

## Implementation Notes

- Use existing docs structure under `docs/` and `examples/`.
- Assumption: examples can be validated via existing CI examples tests.

## Tasks

- [ ] Add a DX comparison page under `docs/` (new guide or appendix).
- [ ] Update quick start in `docs/getting-started/` with presets and FastAPI setup.
- [ ] Create migration guides in `docs/guides/` for stdlib, loguru, structlog, and old fapilog.
- [ ] Update API reference and settings guide for new APIs.
- [ ] Add or refresh examples in `examples/quickstart/`, `examples/fastapi/`, and `examples/migration/`.
- [ ] Ensure example tests cover new files.

## Tests

- Docs build checks pass (if applicable).
- Examples run in CI or local scripts without errors.
- Link validation passes for new docs pages.

## Definition of Done

Story is complete when ALL of the following are true:

### Code Complete
- [ ] All acceptance criteria met and verified
- [ ] All tasks completed
- [ ] Code follows project style guide
- [ ] No linting errors or warnings
- [ ] Type checking passes (mypy strict)

### Quality Assurance
- [ ] Unit tests: >90% coverage of new code
- [ ] Integration tests: all scenarios passing
- [ ] Regression tests: no existing functionality broken
- [ ] Performance tests: no regression vs baseline
- [ ] Manual testing completed (if applicable)

### Documentation
- [ ] User-facing docs updated
- [ ] API reference updated (if applicable)
- [ ] Code examples added/updated
- [ ] CHANGELOG.md updated
- [ ] Inline code documentation complete

### Review & Release
- [ ] Code review approved
- [ ] Documentation reviewed for clarity
- [ ] CI/CD pipeline passing
- [ ] Ready for merge to main branch

### Backwards Compatibility
- [ ] No breaking changes OR breaking changes documented with migration guide
- [ ] Existing tests still pass
- [ ] Deprecation warnings added (if applicable)

## Risks / Rollback / Monitoring

### Risks

- **Risk:** Docs drift from implementation
  - **Mitigation:** Regular reviews, link validation in CI

- **Risk:** Migration guides become outdated
  - **Mitigation:** Version migration guides, regular updates

### Rollback Plan

- Keep docs changes isolated
- Revert if APIs change
- Documentation can be updated independently

### Success Metrics / Monitoring

- Track docs issues and usage feedback
- Monitor migration guide usage
- User feedback on documentation clarity
