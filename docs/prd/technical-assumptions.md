# Technical Assumptions

## Repository Structure: Monorepo

The project will use a monorepo structure to maintain all related components (core library, plugins, documentation, tools) in a single repository for easier development and versioning.

## Service Architecture: Monolith

The core library will be a monolithic architecture with clear separation of concerns through the plugin system. This provides the best balance of simplicity, performance, and maintainability.

## Testing Requirements: Full Testing Pyramid

The project will implement a comprehensive testing pyramid including unit tests, integration tests, performance tests, and enterprise compliance tests. All tests will be async-first to match the library architecture.

## Additional Technical Assumptions and Requests

- **Async-first throughout**: All components must be designed for async operation from the ground up
- **Zero-copy operations**: Memory efficiency through zero-copy serialization and processing
- **Plugin architecture**: Extensible plugin system for sinks, processors, enrichers, and future alerting
- **Enterprise compliance**: Built-in support for PCI-DSS, HIPAA, SOX compliance
- **Performance optimization**: Parallel processing, connection pooling, and adaptive systems
- **Container isolation**: Perfect isolation between logging instances with zero global state
- **Type safety**: Comprehensive async type annotations throughout the codebase
- **Documentation excellence**: Comprehensive async examples and enterprise deployment guides
