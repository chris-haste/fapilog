# Epic 2: Performance Revolution

**Epic Goal**: Achieve revolutionary performance improvements through zero-copy operations, parallel processing, and async-first optimizations while maintaining architectural excellence and perfect container isolation.

**Integration Requirements**: All performance optimizations must recreate the excellent v2 patterns while achieving revolutionary throughput improvement and latency reduction.

## Story 2.1: Zero-Copy Operations

As a developer,
I want zero-copy serialization and processing throughout the pipeline,
so that I can achieve maximum memory efficiency and performance without data copying overhead.

**Acceptance Criteria:**

1. Zero-copy serialization recreating event structure and metadata
2. Memory-mapped persistence recreating sink patterns for file operations
3. Plugin zero-copy operations recreating plugin performance within 10% of core
4. Plugin performance benchmarks recreating quality standards
5. Memory views for efficient data access without copying
6. Efficient serialization formats (JSON, Protobuf, custom) with zero-copy
7. Batch processing with zero-copy operations for maximum throughput
8. Memory usage monitoring and optimization throughout pipeline

## Story 2.2: Parallel Processing Pipeline

As a developer,
I want parallel processing throughout the async pipeline with controlled concurrency,
so that I can achieve 500K-2M events/second throughput with optimal resource utilization.

**Acceptance Criteria:**

1. Parallel enrichment with async gather for multiple enrichers
2. Parallel processing with async gather for multiple processors
3. Zero-copy serialization and async sink delivery
4. Controlled concurrency to prevent resource exhaustion
5. Adaptive batch sizing recreating batching excellence
6. Adaptive backpressure recreating error handling patterns
7. Plugin parallel processing recreating plugin performance
8. Performance monitoring with real-time metrics collection

## Story 2.3: Async Resource Management

As a developer,
I want async connection pooling and resource cleanup,
so that I can achieve optimal performance for HTTP sinks and other external services.

**Acceptance Criteria:**

1. Async connection pooling recreating HTTP sink patterns
2. Async resource cleanup recreating lifecycle management
3. Plugin resource management recreating plugin lifecycle
4. Plugin resource monitoring recreating observability
5. Connection pooling for database sinks and external APIs
6. Automatic resource cleanup with async context managers
7. Resource monitoring and alerting for resource exhaustion
8. Graceful degradation when resources are limited

## Story 2.4: High-Performance Features

As a developer,
I want lock-free data structures and async work stealing,
so that I can achieve maximum concurrency and performance without blocking operations.

**Acceptance Criteria:**

1. Lock-free data structures recreating thread safety
2. Async work stealing recreating concurrency patterns
3. Plugin high-performance features recreating plugin excellence
4. Plugin performance optimization recreating marketplace quality
5. Non-blocking queue operations with async patterns
6. Efficient memory allocation and deallocation
7. CPU cache-friendly data structures and algorithms
8. Performance profiling and optimization tools
