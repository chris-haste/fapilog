# Epic 5: Developer Experience & Documentation

**Epic Goal**: Create comprehensive developer experience with async documentation, excellent type safety, and intuitive async-first API design that enables immediate productivity.

**Integration Requirements**: Developer experience must recreate v2 usability patterns while adding comprehensive async-first idioms and type safety.

## Story 5.1: Async-First API Design

As a developer,
I want an intuitive async-first API that feels natural and powerful,
so that I can be immediately productive with the library without learning complex patterns.

**Acceptance Criteria:**

1. Simple async logger with immediate productivity
2. Async context managers for automatic resource management
3. FastAPI middleware and lifecycle integration
4. Depends-based logger injection for FastAPI endpoints
5. Plugin development experience recreating ecosystem growth
6. Plugin marketplace UX recreating user experience
7. Comprehensive type safety with 100% async type coverage
8. Intuitive error messages and debugging information
9. Zero configuration for basic use cases
10. Rich documentation with real-world examples

## Story 5.2: Comprehensive Type Safety

As a developer,
I want comprehensive async type annotations throughout the codebase,
so that I can get excellent IDE support and catch errors at development time.

**Acceptance Criteria:**

1. Comprehensive async type annotations recreating type safety
2. Generic async interfaces recreating extensibility
3. Plugin type safety recreating plugin quality
4. Plugin type checking recreating marketplace quality
5. 100% type coverage for all async operations
6. Type-safe plugin interfaces and implementations
7. IDE support for async patterns and plugins
8. Type validation for configuration and plugins

## Story 5.3: Documentation Excellence

As a developer,
I want comprehensive documentation with async examples and enterprise deployment guides,
so that I can quickly understand and implement the library in any environment.

**Acceptance Criteria:**

1. Async-first documentation recreating clarity
2. Async usage examples recreating usability
3. FastAPI-specific guides and examples for middleware setup, lifecycle registration, plugin usage, exception logging, and testing
4. Plugin documentation recreating ecosystem growth
5. Plugin marketplace documentation recreating user experience
6. Enterprise deployment guides for compliance and integration
7. Performance tuning guides for high-throughput applications
8. Plugin development guides for community contributors
9. Troubleshooting guides for common issues and solutions

## Story 5.4: Testing Excellence

As a developer,
I want comprehensive async testing framework with plugin testing utilities,
so that I can ensure code quality and reliability in async environments.

**Acceptance Criteria:**

1. Async testing framework recreating test coverage
2. Async performance testing recreating benchmark excellence
3. Plugin testing excellence recreating plugin quality
4. Plugin testing automation recreating marketplace quality
5. 90%+ test coverage with async testing patterns
6. Performance benchmarks for all components
7. Plugin testing utilities and examples
8. Enterprise compliance testing framework
