2. Immutable log storage recreating audit trail patterns
3. Enterprise data handling recreating security patterns
4. Compliance plugin architecture recreating extensibility
5. PCI-DSS compliance validation passing
6. HIPAA compliance validation passing
7. SOX compliance validation passing
8. Data handling controls testable and validated

## Story 4.2: Enterprise Observability Standards

As an enterprise developer,
I want canonical log formats and enterprise correlation,
so that I can integrate with enterprise observability platforms and maintain operational standards.

**Acceptance Criteria:**

1. Canonical log formats recreating format excellence
2. Enterprise correlation recreating trace patterns
3. Enterprise platform integration recreating sink patterns
4. Enterprise testing framework recreating test excellence
5. SIEM platform integration working
6. Splunk platform integration working
7. ELK stack integration working
8. Enterprise correlation functioning across systems

## Story 4.3: Enterprise Data Handling

As an enterprise developer,
I want data minimization and value-level redaction,
so that I can handle sensitive data according to enterprise security requirements.

1. Data minimization with allow-list schemas
2. Value-level redaction beyond regex-based approaches
3. Audit trails for all data handling operations
4. Testable controls around sensitive data logging
5. Encryption for sensitive data at rest and in transit
6. Access control for log access and modification
7. Retention policies for data lifecycle management
8. Data integrity verification and monitoring

## Story 4.4: Enterprise Platform Integration

As an enterprise developer,
I want seamless integration with enterprise observability platforms,
so that I can leverage existing enterprise infrastructure and tools.

**Acceptance Criteria:**

1. SIEM platform integration with real-time event streaming
2. Splunk platform integration with optimized data formats
3. ELK stack integration with Elasticsearch compatibility
4. Enterprise platform validation and testing
5. Platform-specific optimizations for performance
6. Enterprise platform authentication and authorization
7. Enterprise platform monitoring and alerting
8. Enterprise platform support and documentation
