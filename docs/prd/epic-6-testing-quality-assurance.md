3. Plugin testing utilities recreating test coverage
4. Async performance testing recreating benchmark excellence
5. Async test runners and utilities
6. Mock components for sinks, processors, and enrichers
7. Performance testing utilities and benchmarks
8. Integration testing framework for end-to-end scenarios

## Story 6.2: Plugin Testing Framework

As a plugin developer,
I want comprehensive testing utilities for developing and validating plugins,
so that I can ensure plugin quality and compatibility with the core library.

**Acceptance Criteria:**

1. Plugin testing framework recreating test excellence
2. Plugin validation tools for quality assurance
3. Plugin performance testing recreating benchmark standards
4. Plugin compatibility testing across versions
5. Plugin security scanning and vulnerability assessment
6. Plugin documentation generation and validation
7. Plugin CI/CD pipeline with automated testing
8. Plugin marketplace quality gates and validation

## Story 6.3: Enterprise Compliance Testing

As an enterprise developer,
I want comprehensive testing for enterprise compliance and platform integration,
so that I can validate compliance requirements and platform compatibility.

**Acceptance Criteria:**

3. HIPAA compliance validation testing
4. SOX compliance validation testing
5. Enterprise platform integration testing
6. Data handling controls testing and validation
7. Security testing for encryption and access control
8. Performance testing for enterprise workloads

## Story 6.4: Performance Testing & Benchmarks

As a developer,
I want comprehensive performance testing and benchmarking tools,
so that I can validate performance improvements and optimize for high-throughput scenarios.

**Acceptance Criteria:**

1. Performance testing framework recreating benchmark excellence
2. Throughput testing for 500K-2M events/second targets
3. Latency testing for <1ms per event requirements
4. Memory usage testing for 80% reduction targets
5. Plugin performance testing within 10% of core performance
6. Enterprise compliance performance testing within 20% of core
7. Scalability testing for linear performance improvements
8. Performance profiling and optimization tools
