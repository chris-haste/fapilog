# User Interface Design Goals

## Overall UX Vision

The fapilog v3 library will provide **immediate productivity with zero configuration** while enabling **unlimited enterprise power through plugins**. The core experience should feel effortless for individual developers (`pip install fapilog` → productive immediately), while the plugin ecosystem provides enterprise capabilities that exceed complex enterprise solutions.

**UX Philosophy**:

- **Zero friction onboarding** - Works perfectly out of the box with no setup
- **Progressive enhancement** - Built-in features handle most use cases, plugins add enterprise power
- **Async-first throughout** - All operations use modern async/await patterns for optimal performance
- **Type-safe development** - Comprehensive type annotations for excellent IDE support

## Key Interaction Paradigms

- **Async-first patterns**: All operations use async/await for optimal performance
- **Context managers**: Automatic resource management with async context managers
- **Plugin ecosystem**: Simple plugin interface for custom sinks, processors, and enrichers
- **Configuration-driven**: YAML/JSON configuration with environment variable support
- **Type-safe**: Comprehensive type annotations for better IDE support

## Core Screens and Views

- **Basic logging interface**: Zero-configuration async logger - works immediately after installation
- **Built-in feature configuration**: Simple YAML/JSON configuration for built-in sinks, processors, enrichers
- **Plugin marketplace**: GitHub Pages-based discovery for community and enterprise plugins
- **Progressive enhancement examples**: Clear documentation showing built-in → plugin progression
- **Plugin development interface**: Simple tools and templates for creating custom plugins
- **Enterprise compliance plugins**: Optional plugin-based compliance validation and audit trails (not core library)

## Accessibility: WCAG AA

The library will support WCAG AA accessibility standards for any web-based interfaces (plugin marketplace, documentation, etc.).

## Branding

The library will maintain the existing fapilog branding while emphasizing the async-first, performance-focused, and enterprise-ready nature of v3.

## Target Device and Platforms: Cross-Platform

The library will support all Python platforms including web applications, desktop applications, mobile applications, and server-side deployments.
