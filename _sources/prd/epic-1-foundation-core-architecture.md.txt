# Epic 1: Foundation & Core Architecture

**Epic Goal**: Create async-first base architecture that recreates and enhances the 9 critical architectural patterns from v2 excellence while achieving revolutionary performance improvements through pure async patterns and zero-copy operations.

**Integration Requirements**: All components must be async-first with perfect container isolation, zero global state, and comprehensive type safety.

## Story 1.1: Async Container Architecture

As a developer,
I want an async-first container with perfect isolation and zero global state,
so that I can create multiple isolated logging instances without any shared state or race conditions.

**Acceptance Criteria:**

1. Container provides perfect isolation between instances with zero global variables
2. Async lifecycle management with proper initialization and cleanup
3. Component dependency injection through async factory methods
4. Thread-safe component management with async locks
5. Memory efficient without global registry or shared state
6. Context manager support for scoped access and automatic cleanup
7. Factory methods for clean instantiation with async configuration
8. Explicit dependency passing (pure DI) for testability and safety

## Story 1.2: Async Component Registry

As a developer,
I want an async component registry that manages plugin discovery and loading,
so that I can dynamically load and manage plugins with proper lifecycle isolation.

**Acceptance Criteria:**

1. Async component registry with plugin discovery and loading
2. Thread-safe component management with lifecycle isolation
3. Plugin versioning and compatibility validation
4. Component lifecycle management with async initialization and cleanup
5. Type-safe component creation with dependency injection
6. Plugin discovery from marketplace and local plugins
7. Component isolation between different container instances
8. Memory leak prevention with proper cleanup mechanisms

## Story 1.3: Async Error Handling Hierarchy

As a developer,
I want comprehensive async error handling with circuit breakers and context preservation,
so that errors are handled gracefully with proper recovery mechanisms and audit trails.

**Acceptance Criteria:**

1. Standardized error types with context preservation in async context
2. Graceful degradation with fallback mechanisms for async operations
3. Retry with exponential backoff for transient failures in async operations
4. Safe execution wrappers for error isolation with async patterns
5. Comprehensive error categorization for different failure types
6. Circuit breaker patterns for preventing cascading failures
7. Plugin error isolation to prevent plugin failures from affecting core system
8. Enterprise compliance error handling with audit trails

## Story 1.4: Async Configuration and Validation

As a developer,
I want async configuration loading with comprehensive validation and plugin marketplace integration,
so that I can configure the library with confidence and easily integrate plugins.

**Acceptance Criteria:**

1. Async configuration loading with environment variable support
2. Pydantic validation excellence with async field validation patterns
3. Plugin configuration validation recreating quality gates
4. Plugin marketplace configuration recreating ecosystem growth
5. Enterprise compliance validation when compliance features are enabled
6. Data handling configuration validation for sensitive data controls
7. Observability configuration validation for enterprise standards
8. Security configuration validation for encryption and access control
